Description
-------------------------------------

*Retroplex Legacy* is a fork of [Sebastian Pitkanen](https://github.com/gitSebastian)'s wonderful 
[Retroplex](https://github.com/gitSebastian/Retroplex) themed skin for [Plex Media Center](http://www.plexapp.com/).

This repository is provided for [Preen.app](http://anomiesoftware.com/Anomie_Software/Preen.html) & users who can not upgrade to Plex Laika (for reasons outlined below).  

_Q. Why a Legacy Repo?_  

_A. It's useful/desirable for a few reasons:_

  1. Sebastian's now only supports Plex 9.5 "Laika" & doesn't currently provide a tag of branch for pre-9.5 Plex users (though he does provide an archive [here](https://github.com/gitSebastian/Retroplex/issues/2)).
  2. Plex 9.5 has some critical bugs which have not been resolved for quite some time & development appears to have slowed. What's more, many user cannot upgrade die to show stopping issues such as the linking of system audio being broken which makes controlling Plex volume via a remote control or on several plugins on a very common hardware configuration impossible: effectively breaking the experience for these users).
  3. The [Preen.app](http://anomiesoftware.com/Anomie_Software/Preen.html) theme manager for Plex utilizes Github for theme installation & without a pre-9.5 Retroplex tag/branch Plex users who cannot upgrade Plex cannot install Retroplex via Preen either).

So in short, many Plex users are stuck with Plex 9.3 for now & do not have an easy path to one of the best themes available; hence retroplex-legacy ;)
